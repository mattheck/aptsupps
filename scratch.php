<h2>WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN USING SUPERSET™</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px !important;">Performance! Minutes after ingesting your first dose of SUPERSET™ you will feel “it” kick in.* You’re not going to grow a second set of ‘traps’, but you can expect significant improvements in exercise performance when properly using SUPERSET™ in conjunction with a proper diet and exercise.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px !important;">So You Can Expect:</p>

<ul class="expect-list">
    <li>  To See Exactly What Is In Your Product, How Much Of It And No Mystery Blends*</li>
    <li>  To Grow In Confidence When Training*</li>
    <li>  To Increase In Strength, Weight And Size*</li>
    <li>  To Achieve Personal Records “PR’s” In Major Lifts*</li>
    <li>  To Experience A Much-Improved Training Experience*</li>
    <li>  To Recover Faster From Exercise*</li>
</ul>

<h2>So why use SUPERSET™?</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 52px !important;">Isn’t it true that regardless of where and how you train the reason you do train is to get results? If you agree with that statement you’ll appreciate the next: APT SPORTS® did not want to create a $35.00 buzz! What SUPERSET™ IS NOT is overstimulated with excessive doses of untested and dangerous ingredients that may be banned in a year. Regretfully, many products in the industry are too focused on the buzz element and not performance.</p>
