<h2>THE SCIENCE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF!</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 52px !important;">These ingredients are the most studied and extensively researched sports nutrition ingredients on the market.* Anyone using creatine as an ergogenic aid (enhancement of physical performance) can do so with a great deal of confidence in the fact that it works.* Scholars and athletes alike have validated creatine as the real deal.*</p>

<h2>So why use APT SPORTS™ SPORT PERFORMANCE™?</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 52px !important;">In an effort to give its customers the best possible source of creatine, APT SPORTS™ uses micronized creatine that represents a higher quality product compared to regular creatine monohydrate.* Due to its smaller particle size (as much as 20 times smaller) the micronized version is believed to be absorbed at a faster rate with improved solubility and less residue at the bottom of the glass.* By using the micronized version of creatine this product won’t sit in the gut long when compared to regular monohydrate or cause the typical distress and discomfort associated with monohydrate.*[/vc_column_text][/one_half][one_half_last][image_with_animation animation="Fade In From Right" image_url="2739" img_link_target="_self"] [/image_with_animation][/one_half_last][/full_width_section][full_width_section bg_pos="Center Center" top_padding="50" bottom_padding="20" class="creatine-work" type="full_width_background" bg_repeat="No-Repeat" background_color="#f1f1f1" text_color="light" text_align="left"][vc_column width="1/1"][vc_column_text]</p>

<h2>HOW DOES SPORT PERFORMANCE™ WORK</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 52px !important;">From its neuroprotective to cardioprotective properties, creatine supplementation has been shown to improve power output. For an athlete, this translates to increasing their capacity for high-intensity exercise, as well as lean body mass. When performing a bicep curl ATP releases one of its phosphate groups converting ATP to ADP. If you push hard enough the set ultimately ends when ATP stores are depleted. In between sets, Creatine donates its phosphate to ADP to generate new ATP for the next set. Users of creatine will typically report that they are able to use more weight for more repetitions and for more reps.</p>
