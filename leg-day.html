Every gym in the known world has a leg press and most are surprisingly exceptional.  The leg press a compound movement is a very good and safer alternative to the KING of leg exercises: the SQUAT but also demands an equal degree of caution. The LP focuses primarily on quadricep development but as you would expect also recruits the calves, glutes and hamstrings.

If you're using a leg press today here are two cautionary tips to keep you safe and in the gym:
<ol>
	<li>At no time LOCK your knees (this is fundamental to every exercise movement and when playing sport)</li>
	<li>Don't bring the weight down so far that your hips begin to rotate up (you want to keep the tension on the quadriceps and not create risk by involving your hips and lower back)</li>
	<li>Make certain that your knees lign up over your feet (this is a no-brainer for so many obvious reasons)</li>
</ol>
Here's a performance tip: Often you see the movement performed in repetition groups, i.e., one might do 5 repetitions and stop and breath and do another 2 or 3 and stop again and breather and then do another two, etc. We want to suggest that if you're shooting for 8 or 10 or 12 repetitions that you begin with one and not stop until you complete the last repetition. Keep all the repetitions moving until the last one. In fact, don't start fast! Pick a repetition speed and attempt to maintain it throughout all of the reps. Naturally, in the later repetitions you may begin to struggle and slow down but that's ok.

In another addition we'll talk about how to incorporate a staggered negative.

Happy "Leg Day"  be safe and don't forget your SUPERSET™![/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]
