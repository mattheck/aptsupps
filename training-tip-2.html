TRAINING TIP #2

To Achieve Maximum Contraction Try This:

Raise your elbows even with your ears, lean your head back and begin the movement with your arms above your head no more then 15 or so inches apart. Move your hands and pinky in toward your face holding a maximum contraction for a two alligator count.

Remember this is a contraction exercise and a finishing movement to your bicep routine. This exercise should be performed with very little weight. You’re trying to achieve maximum contraction under tension.
