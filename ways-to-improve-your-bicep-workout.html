4 Ways To Improve Your Bicep Workout

PREACHER CURLS

If you're looking for an exercise that is 100% biceps look no further. Every gym has one sometimes two even three of those preacher stands bolted into the floor usually right next to or in front of the dumbbells.

I'm not going to write a book but here is some rapid fire things you should know. Let's start with a couple cautionary tips:
<ol>
	<li>DO NOT lock out your arms at the bottom - EVER!</li>
	<li>DO keep a slight bend in the elbows as you lower the weight down to its starting position</li>
	<li>DO NOT jerk or attempt to move the weight upward in the same manner you might when performing an overload loaded barbell curl</li>
	<li>DO move the weight upward with maximum control, pace and tension</li>
</ol>
I like to grab the bar in the bend of the EZ portion (Oh! You can use a straight bar which I don't advise and as well as a curling bar) this allows me to keep tension on my biceps with minimal stress on the elbow joints. The cool thing about the curling bar is that it offers you a variety of options for where and how to grip the bar all which affect the biceps differently.

Try to keep constant tension on your biceps and give it an intense squeeze at the top of the movement as part of one continuous motion.

Lastly, it's ok to push the safety envelope with certain exercises by going heavy. This is NOT one of those exercises. I'm always concerned about bicep tears and injury to the elbows when performing a preacher curl. ALL of this can be avoided at least the risk can be substantially minimized by using caution and low to moderate weight (working for the feel rather than a big number).

Have fun be safe and do lots of posing - lol!
