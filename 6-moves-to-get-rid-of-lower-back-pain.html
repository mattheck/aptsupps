Lower back pain is a very common problem in people engaged in fitness, bodybuilding and weightlifting. Back pain bothers trainees not only in the gym, but in everyday life as well : lower back pain can greatly reduce the ability to move freely, which can reduce one’s capacity and desire to train. But don’t lose hope as there are lower back pain exercises which can get your mobility back to normal.

The cause of lower back pain may be not impaired health, but rather – weak core and back muscles. If a physician confirms that the lower back pain causes are underdeveloped back muscles as well as core muscles, what you need to do is to correct or even create a new workout routine revolving around certain exercises. It is necessary to pay special attention to exercises that target the abdominal muscles, lower back muscles, the lats and the glutes.

Eventually, when the mentioned muscle groups get stronger the pain should subside, but only if you perform all the exercises methodically and accurately. Many people have solved this problem by developing a strong core, back and gluteal muscles.

Often the main cause of lower back pain are weak abdominal muscles which, among other things, adversely affects posture. Because of this, the main load falls on the back muscles, the balance is disturbed, there are discomfort, pain and even cramps in the spine. Therefore, without strong abdominal muscles you should not count on a good posture.

The pathogenesis

According to reports, 85-90% of all people experience lower back pain at least once in a lifetime. In athletes, this percentage is 1-30%, and this is one of the most frequent causes of temporary disability in professional sports. Unfortunately, athletes rarely get down to the root cause of lower back pain. Usually the diagnosis is a strained muscle, and as such, it stays in the cases of acute and chronic pain.

Prevention

To prevent straining the lumbar muscles and ligaments you need to increase the flexibility of the lumbar spine. It is believed that this improves the security during heavy loads on the spine and prevents bouts of lower back pain.

A clear link between lower back flexibility and lower back pain has yet to be proven, but most experts agree that athletes that are not flexible enough are more likely to get a muscle strain in the lower back. Regarding to the prevention of straining during a competition, it is more important to choose the right time to warm up.

Warm-up heats up the body, improves blood flow to the extremities, increases flexibility and thus prevents injury. Strains of the muscles on the limbs are associated with poor warm-up, with weakness, poor flexibility and muscle fatigue. It was recently shown that flexibility achieved during warm-up, is completely lost during the 30-minute rest before the competition.

The relationship between the degree of rigidity and the risk of damage to the waist is still unclear, however keeping the athlete warmed-up just before the competition can help in reducing the risk of muscle strain.

Finally, suffered lower back pain is the most accurate factor of occurrence of back pain in the future. The risk of strains is 3 times higher among athletes that already suffered back pain.

The proposed routine of physical therapy serves to strengthen the muscular system, but there is no conclusive evidence that it reduces the frequency of back pain in athletes that already suffered. Probably the best way to prevent lower back pain is to use good form and equipment while training and to combine it with a proper workout.

Each person feels pain in differently, so it is always necessary to talk about this with your physician and decide together how to solve this problem quickly and effectively. If the cause of the pain are untrained muscles, in this case, these lower back pain exercises can do the trick.
