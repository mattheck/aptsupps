Here are a few things to consider on journey for growth and gains:

1.) Don't be Afraid to Warm Up

Some hardcore lifters might look down on warmups and go straight for the prize. However, elastically easing your way in with a concise yet effective warmup routine may help you put up more weight. Having the opportunity to commit proper form to memory with lighter weight before going for your personal record (PR) can not only reduce your chance of form-induced failure, but also reduce the negative consequences of bad form under the most weight you've ever attempted.

2.) Go Heavy Earlier than Later

This one may seem obvious, but you would be surprised how many people make the impetuous decision late into their workout to go for a PR. Sometimes it just "feels right" to go for it, however keep in mind on which side of your workout you have the most energy to perform. That being said, a thorough yet concise warmup followed by a couple more sets before your PR attempt might be your best solution.

3.) Know When to Start Increasing the Weight

Now that you've established your personal records, how do you know when to try to set new ones? Veteran weight lifters make this assessment like scientists, each with their own, yet collectively similar, method of measuring progress. Let's make an example, if your one-rep max on the bench press is 275 lbs, you might keep an eye one your max-reps for 255 lbs (let's say 3 reps), 225 lbs (let's say 6 reps) and 185 lbs (let's say 10 reps). If you notice a consistent increase of 1 to 2 reps in your 255 or 225 lifts, it might be time to set a +10 or +15 lbs PR! Safety is critical, and having an experienced spotter by your side can make all the difference.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]
